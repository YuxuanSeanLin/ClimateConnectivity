# Principles of Climate velocity
Climate velocity is a proxy that track the speed and direction of isothermal movement.

See details on [Burrows et al. 2011](https://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1210288), [Brito-Morales et al. 2018](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169534718300636).

# VoCC package (in R)
VoCC is a R-based tool that could calculate gradient-based velocity and trajectory.
See details on [Garcia Molinos et al. 2019](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/2041-210X.13295).
```R
# Installation from GitHub
devtools::install_github("JorGarMol/VoCC", dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE)
