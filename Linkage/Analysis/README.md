# Principles of LCP model
Least-cost Path model dipicts the potential migration between patches (core areas) against <span style="border-bottom:2px dashed yellow;">movement barrier (resistance)</span>, 
and optimizes pathways where minimized cumulative costs (corridors) could be achieved.

See details on [McRae et al., 2012](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0052604).


# Principles of Climate Connectivity
Climate connectivity quantify the extent (capacity) to which patches could enable species to track suitable climate by tracing thermal gradient.

See details on [McGuire et al., 2016](http://www.pnas.org/lookup/doi/10.1073/pnas.1602817113), [Senior et al., 2019](http://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-019-0529-2).


# Overview of Linkage Mapper
Linkage Mapper is an free ArcGIS-based tools that broadly used in connectivity planning.
